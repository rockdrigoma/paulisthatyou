Romans

Rom.1

[1] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
[2] (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
[3] Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
[4] And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
[5] By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
[6] Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
[7] To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[8] First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
[9] For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
[10] Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
[11] For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
[12] That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
[13] Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
