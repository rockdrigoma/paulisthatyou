This project is intended to determine the authorship of the Bible's Epistle to the Hebrews. Experts and theologians say it belongs to Apostle Paul but there is no enough evidence of it.

##Method

In this project, I will try to use two methods in order to get a probability on whether Paul wrote 'Hebrews' or not. First one is the Impostors method proposed by M. Koppel and Y. Winter (2014) and the second one on Sparse Representation Classification by Wright et. al. (2009).
